# Hello

I work in information security, specifically the part that involves being paid to hack into networks and helping people secure things. I've given [talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXu5LzFyin-l29xVfd-zEmlBhTbJNQrQR), training, and [created ](https://github.com/jaredhaight/PSAttack)some [stuff ](https://github.com/FactionC2/Faction)that I think is kind of cool.

I don't write much but I have a couple articles that people have found helpful and the hosting provider for my last site shutdown, so here we are. 

Easiest way to reach me is probably through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaredhaight).
